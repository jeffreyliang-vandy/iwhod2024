## Introduction

Hypothetically, you found a procedure $X$ is associated with survival with a small HIV cohort in Mexico, now, you want to generalize this finding to a larger cohort.

**How difficult it is to get a hand on the data?**

-   Application, Concept sheet, Approval waiting time...

-   CITI, HIPAA training, Data center training

-   Access the data only in facility or use VPN

-   Rules of storing and sending the data

## Introduction

Journal or funding agency request the data you use for analysis as supplements:

**What about publishing the data?**

-   Re-identity risk/ Privacy concern/ Patient stigmatized

-   HIPAA, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

-   Data sharing agreement

-   Loss of information when de-identifying and adding noise

## Introduction

Currently, privacy regulation is a gap for open science

## Synthetic Data

**Synthetic data with Machine Learning**

-   **No real record/patient is in the data**, but it reflects the true data
-   **Since it is not real, it provide a workaround of current regulations**
-   Minimum assumptions or constraints with respect to the associations between variables
-   And there has been example that using both real and synthetic data together can increase accuracy
-   There are already freely available synthetic database for research ie. The Synthetic Data Vault

## Synthetic Data

To Recap:

-   No real patient information is in it
-   It has most of the information in the real data

\textbf{So, can we use synthetic data to bridge the gap of open science and privacy protection?}

## Introduction

![](ccasanet.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   Caribbean, Central and South America Network for HIV Epidemiology (CCASAnet)

-   59208 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Peru

-   **To develop a synthetic dataset for the CCASAnet that replicates the original dataset's structure and variable associations, facilitating its public use for**

    -   Reproducible research and

    -   **Hypothesis generation**

# Method

## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Model

::: columns
::: {.column width="67%"}
![Zhang, Ziqi et al. JAMIA vol. 27,1 (2020)](gan_model.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
1.  A **Generator** is trained on the real data to **generate similar records**

2.  A **Discriminator** is trained to **identify fake/generated records**

3.  Generator **competes** with Discriminator until Discriminator cannot identify the fake data

## Training Data

![Training Data Set](consort.png){width="7cm" height="7cm"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   We use CCASAnet dataset enrolled before 2022.

-   Need to transform into Machine Learning Format

-   There is a detailed [[tutorial and code]{.underline}](https://github.com/yanchao0222/tutorial_data_synthesis_and_evaluation/tree/main) by Chao Yan available online

  Include:
  -Age,Gender,Center,Education Levels,
  -RNA vival load at First visit,CD4 Counts at First visit,
  -ART treatment type,date,termination reasons,
  -Enrollment Date,Birth Date,Death Date and follow-up outcome(Death).
          ",just='left') 

plot(g,grViz = F)

```

## Evaluation

-   **Utility**: How well the synthetic data reflect the real data: We will look into data distribution and associations

-   **Privacy**: How well the synthetic data protect the real data: We will use two common used metrics to evaluating risk of information leakage and re-identification

-   **Real Application**: How well the synthetic data can be used in real analysis

    *Mortality and loss to follow-up among HIV-infected persons on long-term antiretroviral therapy in Latin America and the Caribbean*

Real Data vs. Synthetic Data

## Data Privacy

-   Attribution Risk: How likely unknown attribute values of interest are predicted from a set of leaked attribute values with a trained model from the fake data

-   Membership Risk: How likely a real record can be reconstruct from a leak generative model

|           | Attribution Risk | Membership Risk |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Synthetic | 0.32             | 0.37            |
| Real      | 0.51             | 0.83            |

## Study Reproduciblity

-   We modeled the first visit data, and use patient profile to predict their survival(time-to-event), this imposes the assumption that the survival is only related the first visit.

# Roadmap

## Adapt to longitudinal models

![Zhang, Ziqi, et al. JAMIA 28.3 (2021): 596-604.](synteg.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="6.8cm"}

## Future works

-   Missingness is an attribute in EHR data, we want our synthetic data to reflect the missing pattern in the real data when publish

-   So far, because of the limitation of algorithm and computation time, we use only a single imputation method to prepare the data

-   Rare Event (p\<0.001) cannot be properly captured by the model

-   It is encouraged to check the data for abnormalities post-generation (ie. male record with Cervical cancer)

-   Further improve privacy protection

-   Develop a evaluation method that shows confidence of any hypothesis generated from the synthetic data

## Summary

-   We developed a version of synthetic dataset for the CCASAnet that replicates the original dataset's structure and variable associations

-   It allows researchers to use the data to reproduce the study, identify problems, and produce more results

-   It shows a path forward for open science, but one must also keep in mind the quality and privacy risk of the data when published and used.

## Other Methods

We chose the GAN model because our team has experts in this field and it (SynTEG) is used as a comparison standard in most recent papers.

We want to point out that other methods are available and produce similar or better results depending on the characteristics of the data.
